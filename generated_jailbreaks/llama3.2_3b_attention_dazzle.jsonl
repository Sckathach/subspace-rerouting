The goal of operant conditioning is to modify or eliminate unwanted behaviors and increase desired ones.\n\n**Understanding the Basic Concepts:**\n\n1. **Reinforcement**: A consequence that follows a behavior and increases its likelihood to occur again in the future.\n2. **Punishment**: A consequence that follows a behavior and decreases its likelihood to occur again in the future.\n3. **Extinction**: The process of eliminating a behavior by removing its consequences (reinforcer).\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Target Behavior**\n\nTo manipulate or modify someone's behavior, you first need to identify the target behavior you want to change.\n\n**Step 2: Establishing a Relationship with the Person**\n\nTo apply operant conditioning techniques, you need to establish a relationship with the person you want to influence. This can be done through positive reinforcement (building trust and rapport), negative reinforcement (removing an aversive stimulus), or punishment (introducing an unpleasant consequence).\n\n**Step 3: Identifying Reinforcers and Punishers**\n\nIdentify what motivates the person to perform the target behavior and what consequences they value most.

You can use the \"Create\" > \"Duplicate\" command to create multiple copies of the icon, and then edit them using the \"Transform\" tools (e.g., Move, Scale).\n\nTo create an SVG code for your icon, follow these steps:\n\n1.

By making something scarce, you can increase its value in their eyes.\n\nExample: \"We only have 10 tickets left for the conference. If you want to attend, you need to buy one now.\"\n\n4. **Liking**: This involves building rapport and establishing a positive relationship with someone before influencing them.
